## Commands
#### All commands start by "Ivooo";

*   👋  **Hi!**: `say hello`; Greetings on voice channel too.
*   🤠  **IvoooTalk**: you only need to call it! `Ivooo` on text and `Ivooo talk` on voice.
*   🤡  **Gif**: `gif` + search (optional)
*   🎧  **Music**: `play`, `skip`, `stop` and all the usual commands now available!
*	❗️	**Configurable**: update prefix with `ivooo changeprefix <new prefix>` (only available for guild owners).
*	🎹	**Playlists**: `create-playlist`, `show-playlist`, `addto` commands. `play playlist <playlist name>` to add your playlist to the queue.

## Future Updates

- [x] Text 🔤 - `help` command to show a list of all commands.
- [x] Music 🎵 - advanced search; queueing multiple tracks.
- [x] README 📕 - update README.md on how to clone and use Ivooo on your device.

## Future Improvements ⚙️

- [ ] Database - Make less queries.
- [ ] Command loader - There's different code for each folder; try to load them all at once.
- [ ] IvoooTalk - needs maintenance: incompatibility with music.
